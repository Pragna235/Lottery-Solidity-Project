# Lottery-Solidity-Project

<h3> Lottery Smart Contract Deployment Playbook</h3>

* Code your lottery smart contract in `Solidity` Language by running it in the `Remix IDE`.
* Download and install the `Metamask` Extension to your web browser.
* Switch to the `Goerli` or `Sepolia` testnets to deploy and test your smart contract. Both of these are Ethereum testnets. Now, `Ethereum` is a `mainnet` which requires actual ethers for transactions and to deploy your smart contract. So, for now, we'll use the testnet Goerli.
* Once it's done, create a new account for your smart contract. This will show you that, you have `0` ethers in your account. Now, to deploy the smart contract written, we need ethers.
* In order to add fake ethers to your account, go to `sepoliafaucet.com'.
* Sign up and log in to your 'Alchemy` dashboard.
* Paste your account address and click `send ETH`. Once the transaction is successful, you will 0.5 ETH in your account wallet.
* Now, open your Remix IDE and navigate to your contract's `Deploy & Run Transactions` section and change the environment to `Injected Provider- Metamask` and connect your metamask account.
* Click on `Deploy` and confirm the transaction.
